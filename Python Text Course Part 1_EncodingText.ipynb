The categories must be converted into numbers. This is required for both input and output variables that are categorical.\n\n## Integer Encoding\nWe could use an integer encoding directly, rescaled where needed. This may work for problems where there is a natural ordinal relationship between the categories, and in turn the integer values, such as labels for temperature \u2018cold\u2019, warm\u2019, and \u2018hot\u2019.",

They can also be developed as standalone models and used for generating new sequences that have the same statistical properties as the source text.\n\nLanguage models both learn and predict one word at a time. The training of the network involves providing sequences of words as input that are processed one at a time where a prediction can be made and learned for each input sequence.\n\nSimilarly, when making predictions, the process can be seeded with one or a few words, then predicted words can be gathered and presented as input on subsequent predictions in order to build up a generated output sequence\n\nTherefore, each model will involve splitting the source text into input and output sequences, such that the model can learn to predict words.\n\nThere are many ways to frame the sequences from a source text for language modeling.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore 3 different ways of developing word-based language models in the Keras deep learning library.\n\nThere is no single best approach, just different framings that may suit different applications.\n\n",

The function returns an integer encoded version of the document. The use of a hash function means that there may be collisions and not all words will be assigned unique integer values.\n\nAs with the text_to_word_sequence() function in the previous section, the one_hot() function will make the text lower case, filter out punctuation, and split words based on white space.\n\nIn addition to the text, the vocabulary size (total words) must be specified.

This is an acronym than stands for \u201cTerm Frequency \u2013 Inverse Document\u201d Frequency which are the components of the resulting scores assigned to each word.\n\nTerm Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.\nInverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.\nWithout going into the math, TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents.\n\nThe TfidfVectorizer will tokenize documents, learn the vocabulary and inverse document frequency weightings, and allow you to encode new documents. Alternately, if you already have a learned CountVectorizer, you can use it with a TfidfTransformer to just calculate the inverse document frequencies and start encoding documents.\n\nThe same create, fit, and transform process is used as with the CountVectorizer.\n\nBelow is an example of using the TfidfVectorizer to learn vocabulary and inverse document frequencies across 3 small documents and then encode one of those documents.m",

The clever part is that no vocabulary is required and you can choose an arbitrary-long fixed length vector. A downside is that the hash is a one-way function so there is no way to convert the encoding back to a word (which may not matter for many supervised learning tasks).\n\nThe HashingVectorizer class implements this approach that can be used to consistently hash words, then tokenize and encode documents as needed.\n\nThe example below demonstrates the HashingVectorizer for encoding a single document.\n\nAn arbitrary fixed-length vector size of 20 was chosen. This corresponds to the range of the hash function, where small values (like 20) may result in hash collisions. Remembering back to compsci classes, I believe there are heuristics that you can use to pick the hash length and probability of collision based on estimated vocabulary size.\n\nNote that this vectorizer does not require a call to fit on the training data documents.
