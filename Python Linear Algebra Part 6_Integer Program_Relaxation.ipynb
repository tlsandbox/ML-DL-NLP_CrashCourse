If you can't quickly solve the problem with a good worst case time, maybe you can come up with a method for solving a reasonable fraction of the common cases.\n- Solve the problem approximately instead of exactly. A lot of the time it is possible to come up with a provably fast algorithm, that doesn't solve the problem exactly but comes up with a solution you can prove is close to right.\n- Use an exponential time solution anyway. If you really have to solve the problem exactly, you can settle down to writing an exponential time algorithm and stop worrying about finding a better solution.\n- Choose a better abstraction. The NP-complete abstract problem you're trying to solve presumably comes from ignoring some of the seemingly unimportant details of a more complicated real world problem. \n\n\n- Classification of problems\n\n**P**. \n- Problems that can be solved in polynomial time. \n- (\"P\" stands for polynomial.) \n\n\n**NP**. \n- This stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\" where nondeterministic is just a fancy way of talking about guessing a solution. \n- A problem is in NP if you can quickly (in polynomial time) test whether a solution is correct \n- NP does not stand for \"non-polynomial\". There are many complexity classes that are much harder than NP.\n\n### So P or NP\n- Although defined theoretically, many of these classes have practical implications. \n- For instance **P** is a very good approximation to the class of problems which can be solved quickly in practice -- \n- usually if this is true, we can prove a polynomial worst case time bound, and conversely the polynomial time bounds we can prove are usually small enough that the corresponding algorithms really are practical. \n- NP-completeness theory is concerned with the distinction between the first two classes, P and NP.\n\n### Examples:\n\n#### Example 1: Long simple paths.\nA simple path in a graph is just one without any repeated edges or vertices. To describe the problem of finding long paths in terms of complexity theory, we need to formalize it as a yes-or-no question: given a graph G, vertices s and t, and a number k, does there exist a simple path from s to t with at least k edges? A solution to this problem would then consist of such a path.\n\nWhy is this in NP? If you're given a path, you can quickly look at it and add up the length, double-checking that it really is a path with length at least k. This can all be done in linear time, so certainly it can be done in polynomial time.\n\nHowever we don't know whether this problem is in P; I haven't told you a good way for finding such a path (with time polynomial in m,n, and K). And in fact this problem is NP-complete, so we believe that no such algorithm exists.\n\n\n#### Example 2: Cryptography.\n\nSuppose we have an encryption function e.g.\n\n    code=RSA(key,text)\n    \nThe \"RSA\" encryption works by performing some simple integer arithmetic on the code and the key, which consists of a pair (p,q) of large prime numbers. One can perform the encryption only knowing the product pq; but to decrypt the code you instead need to know a different product, (p-1)(q-1).\nA standard assumption in cryptography is the \"known plaintext attack\": we have the code for some message, and we know (or can guess) the text of that message. We want to use that information to discover the key, so we can decrypt other messages sent using the same key.\n\nFormalized as an NP problem, we simply want to find a key for which code=RSA(key,text). If you're given a key, you can test it by doing the encryption yourself, so this is in NP.\n\nThe hard question is, how do you find the key? For the code to be strong we hope it isn't possible to do much better than a brute force search.\n\nOne can test a factorization quickly (just multiply the factors back together again), so the problem is in NP. Finding a factorization seems to be difficult, and we think it may not be in P. However there is some strong evidence that it is not NP-complete either; it seems to be one of the (very rare) examples of problems between P and NP-complete in difficulty.\n\n#### Example 3: Chess.\n\nWe've seen in the news recently a match between the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, and a very fast chess computer, Deep Blue. The computer lost the match, but won one game and tied others.\n\nWhat is involved in chess programming? Essentially the sequences of possible moves form a tree: The first player has a choice of 20 different moves (most of which are not very good), after each of which the second player has a choice of many responses, and so on. Chess playing programs work by traversing this tree finding what the possible consequences would be of each different move.\n\nThe tree of moves is not very deep -- a typical chess game might last 40 moves, and it is rare for one to reach 200 moves. Since each move involves a step by each player, there are at most 400 positions involved in most games. If we traversed the tree of chess positions only to that depth, we would only need enough memory to store the 400 positions on a single path at a time. This much memory is easily available on the smallest computers you are likely to use.\n\nSo perfect chess playing is a problem in PSPACE. (Actually one must be more careful in definitions. There is only a finite number of positions in chess, so in principle you could write down the solution in constant time. But that constant would be very large. Generalized versions of chess on larger boards are in PSPACE.)\n\n\n## Take out the Theory, Solving integer programs is an NP-hard problem",

            "source": "# Integer Programming\n- integer program is exactly the same as a linear program, with the additional const\n\n\n## Why Must be Integer?\n- One example is problems involving the production of large indivisible items, such as airplanes or cars. \n- It usually does not make sense to use a continuous variable to represent the number of airplanes to produce\n- Another example of where one would use integer variables is to model a particular state, such as on or off. \n- For example, a unit commitment problem where integer variables are used to represent the state of a particular unit being either on or off.\n- Planning of investments also requires integer variables, for example a variable that takes a value of 1 to invest in a warehouse, and 0 to ignore it.\n- Finally, integer variables are often used to model logic between different decision, for example that a given tax break is only applicable if a certain investment is made.\n\n## Modeling techniques with integer and binary variables\n\n- Integer and binary variables are very useful to express logical constraints. \n- Here are a few examples of such constraints.\n\n### Indicator variables\n\n- Indicator variables are binary variables used to indicate whether a certain set of conditions is valid (with the variable equal to 1) or not (with the variable equal to 0). \n- For example, consider a production problem where you want to distinguish between two states, namely production above a minimum threshold, and no production. \n\nTo model this, define a binary variable $y$ to take a value of 1 if the production is above the minimum threshold (called minProd), and 0 if there is no production. Assume $production$ is a continuous variable containing the produced quantity. \nThis leads to these two constraints.\n\n$$\nproduction \\ge minProd * y\\\\\nproduction \\le maxProd * y\n$$\n\nHere, maxProd is an upper bound on the production quantity. Thus, if y = 1, the minimum and maximum production bounds hold, and if y = 0, the production is set to zero. \n\n\n### Logical constraints - an example\n\nFor example, consider an investment decision involving a production plant and two warehouses. \n\n- If the production plant is invested in, then either warehouse 1 or warehouse 2 may be invested in (not both).\n\n- If the production plant is not invested in, then neither of the two warehouses may be invested in.\n\nLet $yPlant$ be 1 if you decide to invest in the production plant, and 0 otherwise. \nSimilar for $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$.\nThen this example can be modeled as follows:\n\n$$\nyWarehouse1 + yWarehouse2 <= yPlant\n$$\n\nIf $yPlant$ is 0 then both $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$ are set to zero. \n\nOn the opposite, if one warehouse variable is set to 1, then $yPlant$ is also set to 1. Finally, this constraint also states that warehouse variables cannot be both equal to 1.\n",

They will not, however, remove any integer feasible points. In a sense, they chop off excess regions of the feasible domain (like cutting off the crust of a toast).\n\n- Namely, we generate valid inequalities (called cuts) from the LP relaxation tableu, \n- that are violated at the current LP fractional solution; meaning that we need to resolve to recover feasibility. \n- We resolve the problem and if we get another fractional solution, we repeat the process. \n- We stop whenever we reach a solution that satisfies all the integrality constraints of the original integer programming problem.\n\n\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81a7af9b262e29ca1c5cf3088d126243-c\" >\n</ul> \n\n\n- The fractional (LP solution) is at the intersection of the two constraints \n- whereas our integer feasible solutions are the solid dots. \n- The dashed line is our cut.

You\u2019ll now see an example of this tree search. \n\n**Consider this integer programming problem, involving**\n- an objective to maximize, \n- three constraints, \n- three non-negative integer variables \n\n\n$\nmaximize\\ x + y + 2 z\\\\\nsubject\\ to: 7x + 2y + 3z <= 36\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 5x + 4y + 7z <= 42\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 2x + 3y + 5z <= 28\\\\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x,y,z \\ge 0\n$\n\n### Branch and Bound: the root node\n\n- The first node of the branch and bound tree is the LP relaxation of the original IP model.  \n- LP relaxation means that the integer variables have been relaxed to be continuous variables.  \n- The solution to the LP relaxation of a maximization IP, such as this, provides an upper bound to the original problem.\n- In this case that bound is eleven and five elevenths.  \n- The current lower bound is minus infinity. \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_43.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\n#### In this case, the solution is fractional and the tree search continues in order to try and find an integer solution.\n\n### Branch and Bound: branching on a variable\n\n- The algorithm next chooses one of the variables to branch on, in this case $x$, and adds two constraints to create two subproblems.  \n- These two constraints are based on the relaxed value of x, namely one and three elevenths.  \n- In the one subproblem, $x$ is required to be less than or equal to one, and in the other problem, \n- $x$ is required to be greater than or equal to two, in order to eliminate the fractional solution found.  \n- IP2 gives another fractional solution, but IP3 gives an integer solution.  \n- This integer solution of 10 is the new lower bound to the original maximization problem, \n- because it is the best current solution to the maximization problem.  \n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_44.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\n- The algorithm will terminate when the gap between the upper and lower bounds is sufficiently small, \n- but at this point there is still more of the tree to explore.\n\n### Branch and Bound: iteration\n\n'\n\n- Next, two more subproblems are created from IP4, namely one with y less than or equal to zero in IP6, \n- and one with y greater than or equal to 1 in IP5.  \n- IP6 yields an integer solution of 11, which is an improvement of the previously found lower bound of 10. \n- IP5 gives a fractional solution and can be explored further.\n\n<p>\n<ul>\n<img src = \"https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/tutorials/jupyter/training/1_47.png?raw=true\" >\n</ul> \n\n- So another two subproblems are created from IP5, namely IP8 with z less than or equal to 4, and IP7 with z greater than or equal to 5.  \n- However, the constraint added for IP4 specifies that z must be less than or equal to 5, so node IP7 immediately yields an integer solution with an objective value of 11, which is the same objective as for IP6.  \n- IP8 yields an integer solution with objective value of 9, which is a worse solution than those previously found and IP8 can therefore be discarded.  \n\n### The optimal solution reported is the integer solution with the best objective value that was found first, namely the solution to IP6.",

But then we need to express that _exactly_ one of those variables must be equal to 1. How can we achive this?\n\nThe answer is to add  the following constraint to the model:\n\n$$\nz_{1} + z_{2} + z_{3} = 1\n$$\n\nThus, if one of zs variables is equal to 0, the two other areequal to zero (remember binary variables can take value 0 or 1).",
